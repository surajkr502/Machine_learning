    "### what is logistic regression?\n",
    "* Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used primarily for classification problems.\n",
    "#### What it does\n",
    "* It predicts the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class.\n",
    "* Unlike Linear Regression (which predicts continuous values), Logistic Regression outputs values between 0 and 1 using the sigmoid (logistic) function.\n",
    "#### Main Uses in Machine Learning\n",
    "1. Binary Classification (two possible outcomes):\n",
    "* Example: Spam (1) or Not Spam (0) in email filtering\n",
    "* Example: Tumor is Malignant (1) or Benign (0) in medical diagnosis\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multi-class Classification (extended using One-vs-Rest or Softmax):\n",
    "* Example: Classifying types of flowers (iris dataset)\n",
    "* Example: Handwritten digit recognition (0â€“9)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Probability Estimation:\n",
    "* It gives not only a predicted class, but also the probability score (e.g., \"This email has a 90% chance of being spam\").\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Feature Impact Analysis:\n",
    "* Since it uses coefficients for features, you can interpret which features increase or decrease the probability of belonging to a certain class."
